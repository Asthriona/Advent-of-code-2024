# Advent of code 2024
This is my AOC 2024. 
Not much to say, Except I didn't change my workflow from how I usually work with the rest of my code.
And also most of this code was made when i was dead tired, so sorry if some bits are low quality. 
Also You may look at my code if you are stuck, but don't just copy paste, it defeat the whole game. 
use it as referance if it can help you. but write your own. learn. got somewhere.
